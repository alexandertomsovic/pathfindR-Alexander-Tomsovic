Hello! This project was created by Alexander Tomsovic!

This project was intended to be a fun project that you can use to try 
and create mazes or puzzles and figure our the best possible way to 
complete said puzzle. This will be updated and I hope to update it 
into a fully functioning tool for people who work in construction or 
architecture to be able to calculate walking distances and for example, 
calculate the walking distance from apartment x to apartment y and then to gym z. 

Hope you like it! :)
